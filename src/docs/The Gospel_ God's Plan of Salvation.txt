The Gospel: God's Plan of Salvation

Introduction

The word "gospel" means "good news." The gospel is the good news of what God has done to save humanity through Jesus Christ. This document explains the core message of the Christian faith with supporting scriptures from the Bible.

1. God's Design: Creation and Purpose

**God created humanity in His image for a relationship with Him.**

In the beginning, God created the world and everything in it, including the first humans, Adam and Eve. He created them to live in perfect relationship with Him.

**Key Scriptures:**
- **Genesis 1:27** - "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them."
- **Genesis 1:31** - "And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good."
- **Colossians 1:16** - "For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him."

2. The Problem: Sin and Separation

**Sin entered the world and separated humanity from God.**

Adam and Eve disobeyed God's command, bringing sin into the world. Since then, all people have sinned and fallen short of God's perfect standard. Sin separates us from God and leads to spiritual death.

**Key Scriptures:**
- **Genesis 3:6-7** - "So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate."
- **Romans 3:23** - "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
- **Romans 6:23** - "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
- **Isaiah 59:2** - "But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear."
- **Ephesians 2:1** - "And you were dead in the trespasses and sins."

3. God's Solution: Jesus Christ

**God sent His Son to bridge the gap between God and humanity.**

Because of His great love, God sent Jesus Christ, His only Son, to earth. Jesus lived a perfect, sinless life, died on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins, and rose from the dead three days later, conquering sin and death.

### Jesus's Sinless Life
- **2 Corinthians 5:21** - "For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."
- **Hebrews 4:15** - "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin."

### Jesus's Death for Our Sins
- **John 3:16** - "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."
- **Romans 5:8** - "But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
- **1 Peter 3:18** - "For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit."
- **Isaiah 53:5-6** - "But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned—every one—to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all."

### Jesus's Resurrection
- **1 Corinthians 15:3-4** - "For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures."
- **Romans 4:25** - "Who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification."
- **Acts 2:24** - "God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it."

4. Our Response: Faith and Repentance

**Salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ, not by our own works.**

We cannot save ourselves through good deeds or religious activities. Salvation is a free gift from God that we receive by faith. This involves:

### Faith in Jesus
Believing that Jesus is the Son of God, that He died for your sins, and that He rose from the dead.

- **Ephesians 2:8-9** - "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."
- **John 1:12** - "But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God."
- **Acts 16:31** - "And they said, 'Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.'"
- **John 14:6** - "Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'"

### Repentance
Turning away from sin and turning toward God, acknowledging Jesus as Lord of your life.

- **Acts 3:19** - "Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out."
- **Luke 13:3** - "No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish."
- **Acts 2:38** - "And Peter said to them, 'Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.'"
- **Romans 10:9** - "Because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."

5. The Result: New Life and Eternal Hope

**Those who trust in Christ receive forgiveness, new life, and eternal life with God.**

When we place our faith in Jesus, we are forgiven of our sins, adopted into God's family, and given new life through the Holy Spirit. We have the promise of eternal life with God.

### Forgiveness and Justification
- **1 John 1:9** - "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
- **Colossians 1:13-14** - "He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins."
- **Romans 8:1** - "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."

### New Birth and Transformation
- **2 Corinthians 5:17** - "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come."
- **John 3:3** - "Jesus answered him, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.'"
- **Titus 3:5** - "He saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit."

### Eternal Life
- **John 3:36** - "Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him."
- **John 10:28** - "I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand."
- **1 John 5:11-13** - "And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life."

### Adopted as God's Children
- **Galatians 3:26** - "For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith."
- **John 1:12** - "But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God."
- **Romans 8:15-16** - "For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, 'Abba! Father!' The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God."

6. The Call: Following Jesus

**Believers are called to follow Jesus as disciples.**

Following Jesus means more than a one-time decision. It involves a lifelong commitment to grow in faith, obey His commands, and share the gospel with others.

### Growing in Faith
- **2 Peter 3:18** - "But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."
- **Philippians 1:6** - "And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ."

### Obedience to Christ
- **John 14:15** - "If you love me, you will keep my commandments."
- **Matthew 28:19-20** - "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."

### Love for God and Others
- **Matthew 22:37-39** - "And he said to him, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"
- **John 13:34-35** - "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."
