A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE BIBLE FELLOWSHIP CHURCH

The Bible Fellowship Church originated in 1858 as the Evangelische Mennoniten Gemeinschaft (Evangelical Mennonite Society), formed by seven Mennonite revivalists who resisted restrictions on their evangelistic style. This group, led by figures like William Gehman, emphasized enthusiastic evangelism while maintaining Mennonite doctrine.

Over time, the fellowship evolved. In 1879, they united with other like-minded Mennonite groups to become the Evangelical United Mennonites, and in 1883, they merged with a small group called Brethren in Christ, forming the Mennonite Brethren in Christ, Pennsylvania Conference. This period saw the development of a church paper, increased structure, and new theological emphases, including Wesleyan teachings on entire sanctification and a focus on the return of Christ.

New leadership emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including William Brunner Musselman and Charles Henry Brunner, who expanded evangelism, established ministries, and promoted foreign missions. The Conference experienced significant growth, doubling in size between 1900 and 1920, and again in the following two decades.

A new era began after World War Two, with changes in leadership and a growing divergence from other Mennonite Brethren in Christ conferences. In 1952, the Pennsylvania Conference separated from the other conferences due to doctrinal, ecclesiological, and programmatic differences.

Finally, in 1959, the Conference adopted its current name, the Bible Fellowship Church. This stage involved the ratification of new articles of faith, the dropping of practices like feet washing, and a shift in church governance. Camp meetings, homes for the aged, and a focus on a biblical basis for all denominational facets were also important features of this period. The church, which began as a loose association of Mennonite revivalists, has evolved into a Reformed fellowship holding to believers' baptism, with a presbyterial structure of government and continued efforts in church planting and education.
