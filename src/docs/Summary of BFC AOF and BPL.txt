Article 154: SEXUAL IMMORALITY
- God's Word declares sexual relations authorized only in union of male and 
  female within marriage bond
- Any sexual act outside this biblical standard is sinful
- Bible teaches activities such as adultery, bestiality, fornication, homosexuality, 
  incest, polygamy, transgenderism, and sexual lust are perversions of God's 
  created order
- Violation of God's Word to admit into church membership or office any 
  unrepentant person engaged in sexual immorality
- Such unrepentance invalidates Christian profession of faith
- When church member yields to sexual immorality, Bible requires fellow 
  believers use church discipline
- To urge individual to repent and be restored

Article 155: AFFILIATIONS
- Highly inconsistent and anti-Scriptural for Christians to be members of 
  organizations/societies binding members with oaths/affirmations requiring 
  involvement in practices or philosophies contrary to allegiance to Christ
- Urge believers to refrain from joining and withdraw membership from any 
  such organization
- Look with grave concern upon organizations requiring secrecy for basic 
  tenets and practices
- Scriptures teach about proper and improper taking of oaths
- While oaths not forbidden, kinds taken by members of such associations 
  clearly against Christ's teaching
- Secrecy and higher allegiance not in keeping with call to be light-bearers
- Violates Christ's example of openness rejecting secret hidden agenda
- Often violates commands not to be yoked with unbelievers nor have fellowship 
  with unfruitful works of darkness
- Of supreme importance: membership must not supercede brotherhood with believers
- Must not violate allegiance to Christ
- Cannot serve God and any other master
- Elders encouraged to seriously consider affiliations of persons seeking 
  membership or holding membership
- Give godly counsel whenever necessary
- May withhold membership or exercise church discipline based on affiliations

Article 156: IMMIGRATION
- God has special love and compassion for alien (immigrant, stranger, outsider)
- Created all human beings in His image; all people from all backgrounds dignified
- Mary, Joseph, and Jesus escaped into Egypt per God's instructions
- Jesus understands plight of refugees leaving hostile conditions
- Jesus equated welcoming stranger with welcoming Him
- Gave special attention to people not accepted
- Spent time with those on society's fringes
- His mission included good news to captives, broken-hearted, oppressed
- New Testament writers challenge church to break down barriers of hostility
- Recognize we too are strangers and aliens
- People migrate for many reasons: economics, armed conflicts, family needs
- Migration provides gospel opportunities that might not otherwise exist
- Church should seek ways to reach alien with good news
- Disciple new believer in way honoring Lord and obeying government laws
- Christians to obey laws of government
- Exception: where regulation conflicts with God's law
- In faithfulness to God, stand against injustice, be voice for oppressed
- Circumstances vary country to country
- Believer should attempt to follow legal process to remain in country
- Christian employers finding employee is illegal immigrant should make every 
  effort to comply with law while seeking ways to minister to employee
- Church must understand priority of heavenly citizenship
- Must not allow political issues to surpass gospel-centered ministry
- Pastors and leaders should give biblical counsel to those illegally residing
- Proclaim truth, pray for Holy Spirit to work in believer's life
- Church should assist believers seeking legal status
- Not all are aliens of own volition: victims of human trafficking and slavery
- Unwillingly working in commercial sex trade, child labor, restaurants, 
  factories, brothels, laundries, sweatshops
