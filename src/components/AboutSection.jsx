              As a reformed Bible church, we hold to the historic Christian
              faith as articulated in the great confessions of the Reformation.
              We believe in the sovereignty of God, the authority of Scripture,
              salvation by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone, and
              the glory of God as the ultimate purpose of all things.
